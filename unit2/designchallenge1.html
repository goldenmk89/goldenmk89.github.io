		<h1>Which Two Websites Are You Most Inspired By?</h1>
		<p><a href="http://baystreetbiergarten.com/">Bay Street BierGarten</a></p>
		<p><a href="http://menagerieclimb.com/">Menagerie</a></p>
		<h1>How Do They Exhibit Effective Use of Space, Size, or Balance?</h1>
		<h2>Bay Street BierGarten</h2>
		<p>Bay Street BierGarten uses size to establish a primary point of interes, or focal point. The viewer is immediately drawn to the words "Good Food, Craft Beer". The negative space puts visual emphasis on the positive space. The size of the focal point suggests the relative importance of the overall message the site is portraying. Lastly, the focal point is balanced center on the page, further drawing the viewers eye to that message.</p>
		<h2>Menagerie</h2>
		<p>The focal point in Menagerie is clearly emphasized through space, size, and balance. The size of the message "Climbing is for everyone" clearly distinguishes the focal point. It creates a hierarchy letting the viewer know the importance of the message. The negative space is creative and visually appealing, but does not take away from the positive space.</p>
		<h1>What Makes Them Similar and Different?</h1>
		<p>Similarities: The sites I have chosen use whitespace to frame a clear focal point. They make use of balance to portray the message intended for the viewer.</p>
		<p>Differences: Menagerie creates more of a hierarchy to emphazise importance of objects on the page. Bay Street Biergarten uses white space pull the view to the focal point and emphazize their message.</p>
		<h1>Thumbnail Sketches</h1>
		<p>I have displayed two thumbnail sketches below, which represent different options for my homepage. I wanted both options to be very simple, as this will be a photography site so I want the view to be directly impacted by the images.</p>
<ul>
	<img src="file:///Users/mgolden/Documents/Web%20Design%20Circuit%20Class/Unit%202/Version%201.jpg">
	<li>The first option would use a slideshow of images as the white space and act as the focal point of the page. The positive space will be limited, as I want the negative space to establish the importance of the site.</li>
<img src="file:///Users/mgolden/Documents/Web%20Design%20Circuit%20Class/Unit%202/Version%202.jpg">
<li>The second option uses only one picture as the focal point, and would be included in the positive space of the site, in addition to a brief few words.</li> 
</ul>
